Challenge Endpoint: `http://challenges.enigmagroup.org/programming/3/`

> Your objective is to analyse the following [random] image (`/3/image.php`),
> and report back the color of the image.
>
> Example:
>
> ![Example](./data/example.jpg)
>
> You will submit the answer back to the image page (under POST), using the
> variables: color=255;255;255&submit=1
>
> The color variable is divided into 3 numbers. These 3 RGB numbers should be
> seperated with a semi-colon ( ; ).
>
> You have one second to analyse the image, and submit it back to the image
> page.

The image is non-static and refreshes with each request.
